# Product Context

## Why this project exists

This repository exists to remove friction when experimenting with modern
React tooling (Vite + TypeScript) and to collect small, demonstrable examples
that show how to compose UI and 3D scenes using React Three Fiber and related
patterns.

## Problems it solves

- Eliminates repeated setup work for demos and quick prototypes.
- Provides canonical examples for error handling, testing, and r3f usage.
- Serves as a teaching and onboarding aid for new contributors.

## How it should work

- Clone, install, and run the dev server with minimal configuration.
- Examples should be discoverable and runnable in isolation.
- Tests should be easy to run locally (Vitest) with basic coverage
  configuration.

## User experience goals

- Clear README and memory files that describe intent and next steps.
- Low cognitive load to run and understand examples.
- Accessible and resilient component examples with good defaults.
