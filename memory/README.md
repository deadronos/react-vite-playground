# Memory Bank README

This folder contains the project's Memory Bank: small, structured artifacts
that capture the project's brief, context, designs, and tasks.

Follow `.github/instructions/memory-bank.instructions.md` when creating or
updating files here. Core files created:

- `projectbrief.md` — high-level project purpose and success criteria.
- `productContext.md` — product goals and UX notes.
- `activeContext.md` — current focus, decisions, and next steps.
- `systemPatterns.md` — architecture and recurring patterns.
- `techContext.md` — tech stack and developer commands.
- `progress.md` — status tracking and known issues.

Task and design artifacts live under `memory/tasks/` and `memory/designs/`.
