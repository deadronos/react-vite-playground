# Project Brief

**Project:** react-vite-playground

**Owner:** deadronos

**Purpose:** Provide a lightweight, repeatable playground for experimenting with
React + Vite patterns, examples (including React Three Fiber), and testing
workflows (Vitest, Playwright). The repository is intended for learning,
prototyping, and capturing best-practice snippets rather than production usage.

**Scope:**

- In scope: small reproducible examples, component patterns, test examples,
  developer documentation, and a Memory Bank for project context and tasks.

- Out of scope: production deployments, user data, and long-running services.

**Goals:**

- Fast local feedback loop: start dev server, run tests, and preview examples.
- Centralized patterns and examples for r3f (react-three-fiber) usage.
- Maintain a structured Memory Bank for decisions, tasks, and designs.

**Success criteria:**

- Developers can run the project locally with documented steps.
- Key examples (r3f view, error boundary) build and are test-covered.
- Memory Bank contains core context files and an initial tasks index.
