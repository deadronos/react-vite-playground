# Progress

## What works

- Project scaffold is present and builds locally.
- Basic examples (r3f view, error boundary) and a couple of tests exist.

## What's left to build

- Add CI that runs tests and optionally Playwright checks.
- Expand examples with additional patterns and edge-case tests.
- Create an onboarding doc for contributors.

## Known issues

- Some example components may lack comprehensive test coverage.
- No CI configured in the repository yet.
